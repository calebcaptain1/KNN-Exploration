# KNN-Exploration
This a K Nearest Neighbors based exploration of the Social Network Ads dataset.

K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a Machine Learning Algorithm that utilizes the data points closest to the unknown point to classify it based on its similarities to its "neighbors".

One common misconception is that KNN is like any other unsupervised learning model, however, it has one paramount difference. KNN technically doesn't create a model so much as it saves the entire dataset that its been given. The "model" then compares and contrasts unknown points to the points that it would be most like inside the saved dataset.
