# KNN-Exploration
This a K Nearest Neighbors based exploration of the Social Network Ads dataset.

K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a Machine Learning Algorithm that utilizes the data points closest to the unknown point to classify it based on its similarities to its "neighbors".

One common misconception is that KNN is like any other unsupervised learning model, however, it has one paramount difference. KNN does not <ins>create</ins> a model so much as it <ins>saves</ins> the entire dataset that has been provided. The "model" then compares and contrasts unknown points to the points that it would be most similar to inside the saved dataset.

One thing that is unique in this exploration is that there was a concerted effort to utilize the interactive graphing library: plotly. An unfortunate commonality in machine learning projects is utilizing the default graphing of matplotlib.pyplot should be eschewed. Interactive graphs are more robust and informative to not only professionals, but anyone not well versed in the field of machine learning and/or data science. 

### How to run the code
